Linear Regression Implementation in Python
------------------------------------------

This is an implementation of linear regression from scratch using a gradient descent algorithim. 

linearRegression1.py
--------------------

This script uses python libraries to perform linear regression on 'ex1data1.txt'. 
It creates a scatterplot of the data and overlays the line found on top of the plot.


linearRegression2.py
--------------------

This script is an implementation of linear regression with gradient descent from scratch. 
The plotting aspect still needs to be completed.
